# OpenAI Functions Proof of Concept

This is a proof of concept for the OpenAI functions API. It is a simple terminal application that allows you
to register new functions, and then call them.

**Warning**: It is not secure and can be easily abused as it could allow arbitrary code execution on your machine.

## Installation

To install, run the following command:

```bash
poetry install
```

### OpenAI API Key

Add your OpenAI API key to the `~/.openai_api_key` file.

## Usage

To run the application, just run the following command from the terminal:

```bash
poetry run chat
```
